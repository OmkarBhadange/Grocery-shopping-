# The-Grocery-Store

This was a college project!

This application is based on shopping grocery items, it doesn't has any payment integration, it was just made for learning purpose!You can fork it and can manipulate it according to your use.

If someone can suggest, better implementation of this project, they are welcome to do so.

### To Cook this project in your kitchen, You need to arrange following items:-
1. Java
2. Firebase [Real time database and Storage]
3. XML
4. google-services.json (I have added it to .gitignore, to avoid misuse of my resources.You should also do the same)
5. You need to Add project to firebase console (your app id, SHA1 key, etc)
I have used library for some widgets, but can use android native widget as well, to avoid increase in app size!

Thanks!
